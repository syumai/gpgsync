# Task Completion Workflow for gpgsync

## When a Development Task is Completed

### Current State Assessment
The project currently has **minimal automation** for task completion verification:
- No linting commands configured
- No automated testing (package.json test script just exits with error)
- No formatting tools set up
- No type checking (plain JavaScript, no TypeScript)

### Recommended Completion Steps

#### 1. Manual Testing
```bash
# Start the server and test manually
node server.js
# Test in browser at http://localhost:8080
# Verify core functionality:
# - Home page loads
# - Room creation works
# - Real-time collaboration functions
# - Go code execution works
```

#### 2. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follow existing code style (2-space indentation, double quotes)
- [ ] Use CommonJS module pattern (`require`/`module.exports`)
- [ ] Separate concerns (handlers, middleware, validators in separate files)
- [ ] Handle errors appropriately
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

#### 3. Git Workflow
```bash
# Check what changed
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"

# For deployment
make deploy  # Pushes to Heroku
```

#### 4. Manual Integration Testing
Since there are no automated tests, perform these manual checks:
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Home page accessible and functional
- [ ] Room creation and joining works
- [ ] Real-time editing synchronization works
- [ ] Go code execution through playground integration works
- [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools

### Future Improvements Needed
The project would benefit from adding:
- ESLint for code quality checks
- Jest or Mocha for automated testing
- Prettier for code formatting
- GitHub Actions or similar for CI/CD
- Unit tests for handlers and utilities
- Integration tests for Socket.IO functionality

### Deployment Verification
After deploying to Heroku:
- [ ] Visit https://gpgsync.herokuapp.com
- [ ] Test basic functionality in production
- [ ] Check Heroku logs for any deployment issues: `heroku logs --tail`
